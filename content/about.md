# **Story**

I grew up in New York City, with stops in Philadelphia, Kentucky, and Venezuela. Dad was a nerd and Mom an entrepreneur, so I was privileged to have access to an apple II, or as Steve Jobs called it, “a bicycle for the mind.”

### **1990s**

**Consulting**

I led a software consulting firm, which enabled me to work with great companies, like Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs, Ogilvy, IBM, AT\&T. Every client taught me a lot about different work styles, creating business value, and building teams.

***

**Start Up**

Working with a brilliant duo from Bell Labs, I co-founded an internet startup that optimized forecasting and scheduling in call centers. I learned about raising capital, selling, partnerships, patents, boards, and more.

### **2001**

**Public Service**

The 9/11 terrorist attack changed my life. I joined Mike Bloomberg’s mayoralty as a CIO/CTO and led digital transformation for multiple agencies, delivering systems which improved the safety and health of  millions of people. I was technology team leader for PC Bratton’s re-engineering of the NYPD. I was a founding architect of the US National Information Exchange Model.

I learned how to create urgency and get things done in complex organizations with regulatory constraints.    

### **2015**

At the nonprofit which operates the US National Suicide Lifeline and Veterans Crisis Line, my role was to bring scale, innovation, and process. We increased revenue 2.5x, headcount 2x; digital fundraising 4x over three years.

Established 988 as national 3-digit number for suicide prevention. As principal technical advisor, I advanced the technical strategy and vision, plus a sustainable technical and funding roadmap, now written into law. This will have a transformative impact on the US response to depression, addiction, and 132 suicides per day.
